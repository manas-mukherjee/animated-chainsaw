##### Overview 
This narrative visualization uses the Interactive Slideshow approach to visualize how the number Caltrain commuters varies across different time-segments of any given weekday. It consists of multiple scenes where each scene has a bar chart that shows 'number of average daily commuters' who commute from different 'South-Bay'/'Peninsula' stations to the San Francisco city(4th and King street). End-user can hover their mouse on any bar(related to a station) and explore(from the tooltip) more contextual information like 'zone information', 'avg. number of commuters', "distance from Sanfrancisco" etc.
